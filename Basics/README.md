# Constants and Variables

## Declaring Constans and Variables

```  
let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
var currentLoginAttempt = 0
```

It's possible declare multiple variables in a single line

```
var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0
```

> Tip: Always declare constants if you need to change it's means that it's a variable

## Type Annotations
```
var welcomeMessage: String
var red, green, blue: Double
```

> It’s rare that you need to write type annotations in practice. If you provide an initial value for a constant or variable at the point that it’s defined, Swift can almost always infer the type to be used for that constant or variable, as described in Type Safety and Type Inference. 

## Naming Constants and Variablesin page link
Constant and variable names can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:

```
let π = 3.14159
let 你好 = "你好世界"
let 🐶🐮 = "dogcow" 
```
