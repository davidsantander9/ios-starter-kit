# Collections Types

Three primary collection types
- Arrays
- Sets
- Dictionaries

> Those are implemented as generics colletions

## Mutability of collections

> var collections = mutability

> let collections = immutable

> Note: It’s good practice to create immutable collections in all cases where the collection doesn’t need to change. Doing so makes it easier for you to reason about your code and enables the Swift compiler to optimize the performance of the collections you create.
